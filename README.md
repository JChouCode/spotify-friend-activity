# Spotify Friend Activity

Hosted on Vercel [here](https://spotify-friend-activity-jchoucode.vercel.app/)!

Also hosted on Render [here](https://spotify-friend-activity.onrender.com/).  Note: it may take a while for it to load (like <3 mins) since I'm on the free plan and Render decomissions my server if theres no activity for 30 mins!

Currently only shows my friends, but can later be adjusted for other users.

## How it works

Hits spotify friend endpoint using a proxy server (also deployed on Heroku) from [spotify-friend-proxy](https://github.com/JChouCode/spotify-friend-proxy) by mimicking the spotify web player using cookies.
