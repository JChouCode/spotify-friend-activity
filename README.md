# Spotify Friend Activity

Hosted on heroku [here](https://spotify-friend-activity.onrender.com/). 

Currently only shows my friends, but can later be adjusted for other users.

## How it works

Hits spotify friend endpoint using a proxy server (also deployed on Heroku) from [spotify-friend-proxy](https://github.com/JChouCode/spotify-friend-proxy) by mimicking the spotify web player using cookies. 

Built in 1 day with React, Express, NodeJS.
